//Question: umber is represented by a linked list, with the head of the linked list being the least significant digit.
//        For example 12 is represented as 2->1, and 23 is represented as 3->2 Adding 2->1 and 3->2 should produce 5->3 which is equivalent to (35).
//
//        Another example
//        Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
//        Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
//        Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

//num = 6 + 4 = 10
//to get 1 = num /10 ; --> becomes the carry
//to get 0 = num mode 10; --> number
//
//num = 6 + 6 = 12
//to get 1 = 12/10 = 1
//to get 2 = 12 mod 10 --> 2
