DP - optimization technique over recursion solutions
DP - has two properties
  1. Overlapping subproblems - Repeating Subproblems T(2^n) you want to optimize
  2. Optimal Substructure  - solution for one could be applied for another substructure

 Not all recursion can use DP only if the above two properties are satisfied. n-queen problem would not use DP.
 for n-queen you have solve all different combinations, there is repeated sub problems but optimal substructure cannot be used.

 What is DP - this technique was discovered by Richard bellman.
            DP
 Memoization vs Iteratively - Interviewer expects us to use Iteratively (real DP)
 Interview would not like memoization

 Iterative DP
   - Mechanical
   - Functional

The DP table will be based on how many parameters change if 2 then it will be two dimension
and if the function returns boolean the DB table will return boolean
