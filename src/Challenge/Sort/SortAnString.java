//Sort ASCII ascending order
//input "baxbcd" output "abbcdx"

//bucketsort gives time complexity convetional sorting
//bucket created is limited and known before hand
//Create buckets and then iterate the buckets

//ASCII questions
//ASCII 126, extended ASCII (0 - 255 or 256) or unicode 4 bytes (4 Billion)
//Create a frequency array of 0 - 255 and then iterate over this and there is some diplicates as well
// when a character reoccurs and increase the value by 1
// 0 1 2 3 ...97 98 .....255
// 0 0 0 0    1  2  1 1 0 0
//Above b occurs 2
