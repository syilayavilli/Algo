3 2 1 6 8 4 5 7

divide the arrays by two and sort each array and then merge
Any sort algorithm - will sort the input and not return the new list
The input data structure should be changed not a new structure of sorted

Divide till you one element is left than that element is sorted
Because for that element there is nothing before or after
Then go back and start merge
