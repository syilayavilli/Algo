package Challenge.Graphs;

//This is prelude to the BinaryMatrix island problem of connected graphs
//We create an undirected graph - the edge is from both sides
//BFS
/*
Start with a node, p.offer(n)
while !q.empty , we poll and get neighbors
add in queue
for all graphs - use a for loop on the top for( each node find connected nodes)
We can have a count++ after completing each group
We also need to use isVisited
     //BFS
     for(each node)
        if !isVisited {
         p.offer(n)

         while(!q.isEmpty) {
             ---
             get neighbors;
         }
         count++;
        }
     }


     //DFS
     for (each node) {
         if !isVisited {
            dfs(n);
            count++;
         }
     }

     void dfs(Node n) {
        get all neighbors
        dfs(--)
     }
