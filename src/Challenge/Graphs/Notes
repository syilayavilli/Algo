Template BFS
Always used to get shortest path - this is preferred over DFS in interview
from one source to destination
You go by level to level - you could hit the shortest path soon

Template DFS
Topological sort DFS is Preferred
To get the actual path - DFS is preferred

Problem:
Shortest path between src and destination in terms of Number of hops between two
either from 0 ->1->2->3 (number of hops is 3) or 0->4->3 (number of hops is 2) the correct answer
This can be done by BFS or DFS. But BFS is faster because BFS does level by level
Lets do BFS. DFS takes a vertix and goes to children of vertex all the way down
but BFS goes breadth ways
